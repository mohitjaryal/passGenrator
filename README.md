# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

## 💡 Overview
The **Password Generator** is a beginner-friendly Python project that creates strong, random, and secure passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.  

This project helped me understand how randomness works in Python, how to manipulate strings, and how to design a simple interactive program for real-world use cases — all using **core Python**, without any external libraries.
